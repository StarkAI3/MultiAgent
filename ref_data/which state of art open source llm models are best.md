# which state of art open source llm models are best for code generation, which we can install locally and use

The top state-of-the-art open-source large language models (LLMs) for code generation in 2025—suitable for local installation—are Qwen 2.5 Coder, Code Llama 70B, DeepSeek Coder V2, Codestral 25.01, and StarCoder2. These models are highly regarded for their code completion, multi-language support, reasoning abilities, and performance on industry benchmarks. All are available under permissive open-source licenses.

Key models and their strengths:

1. Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B Instruct:
    - Outstanding performance in code generation, reasoning, and code fixing; considered competitive with proprietary models like GPT-4o.
    - Supports over 10 programming languages.
    - Apache 2.0 license; models are installable via various open-source tools[^1_1][^1_9].
2. Code Llama 70B (Meta):
    - Excels at code generation, completion, and fills in code gaps (“fill-in-the-middle”).
    - Trained on 1 trillion tokens of code.
    - Supports Python, JavaScript, Rust, and more than 80 other programming languages.
    - MIT license; works well in complex, multi-language codebases but requires significant GPU resources[^1_3][^1_4][^1_9].
3. DeepSeek Coder (V2):
    - Focused on multi-language comprehension and deterministic code completions.
    - Runs efficiently on consumer-grade GPUs (e.g., RTX 4090, RTX 3080), making it practical for local use.
    - Best for production tooling, CI scenarios, and indie dev workflows[^1_3][^1_9].
4. Codestral 25.01 (Mistral AI):
    - Specializes in fast, low-latency code generation across 80+ languages.
    - Features a fill-in-the-middle engine and large 256k context window.
    - Apache 2.0 license; designed for speed and ease of deployment[^1_4][^1_9].
5. StarCoder2:
    - Another leading open code model, receiving significant community and enterprise adoption.
    - Offers strong results in coding benchmarks and diverse language support[^1_9].

Installation and Local Use:

- Tools like Ollama, LM Studio, and vLLM make installing and running these models locally straightforward.
- Ollama is particularly user-friendly, supporting models such as CodeLlama, DeepSeek Coder, Qwen 2.5 Coder, and more with minimal setup for MacOS and Linux (Windows support is increasing).
- Most models require a powerful GPU (often 12GB+ VRAM) but offer quantized/CPU versions for less demanding environments[^1_2][^1_6].

Summary Table:


| Model | License | Notable For | Resource Needs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B | Apache 2.0 | Reasoning, FIM | Moderate |
| Code Llama 70B | MIT | Large codebases | High (GPU) |
| DeepSeek Coder V2 | Apache 2.0 | Deterministic code | Moderate |
| Codestral 25.01 | Apache 2.0 | Speed, FIM, 80+ langs | Moderate |
| StarCoder2 | OpenRAIL | Community support | Moderate/High |

Caveats:

- These models cannot currently match the absolute performance and code reasoning of leading proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus), but their gap has narrowed substantially[^1_3][^1_4].
- Some models (e.g., Code Llama 70B) require significant technical expertise and high-end hardware to deploy at full scale[^1_4][^1_9].
- Benchmark performance, language support, and tool compatibility may vary by model, format, and updates[^1_9][^1_1][^1_2].

For the vast majority of local-code generation workflows, starting with Qwen 2.5 Coder, Code Llama 70B, or DeepSeek Coder is recommended for both capability and hardware flexibility[^1_1][^1_3][^1_9].

# can you please tell me in detail about the hardware requirements for each model

The hardware requirements for local installation and efficient use of each top code generation model differ based on model size and use case (inference vs. training, full vs. quantized versions). Below are details for each major model family, focusing on the largest and most typical variants for code generation:

1. Qwen 2.5 Coder (32B, 14B, 7B):
    - 32B: For full precision, requires high-end GPUs such as NVIDIA A100 or H100 with at least 40GB to 80GB of VRAM for production use. Minimum for experimentation is 24GB (e.g., RTX 3090), but performance and context window will be heavily limited[^2_2][^2_3][^2_5].
    - 14B: Needs at least 24GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 4090) for efficient execution. Quantized versions can run on lower-end GPUs but with reduced performance[^2_4].
    - 7B: Can be used with 12GB–16GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060 or T4) and as little as 16–32GB of system RAM for local desktop usage (e.g., via Ollama or LM Studio), especially when using quantized or GGUF/LLM versions[^2_1][^2_8][^2_9].
    - For Mac users, at least 48GB unified memory (on M2/M3 Max/Ultra) is recommended for 32B, and 16GB+ for 7B.
2. Code Llama 70B:
    - Full-precision models require 70B parameters and thus a server-class GPU setup: typically, 80GB VRAM (A100, H100) or 2–4x 40GB cards in parallel. For local use, quantized models (such as 4-bit or 8-bit) can run on a single RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM), but with slower performance and lower context windows[^2_4].
    - Quantization or CPU-only mode is possible via llama.cpp or Ollama, but practical only for small demos.
3. DeepSeek Coder V2:
    - 7B and 16B variants run well on 16GB–24GB VRAM GPUs (RTX 3080, 3090, or Apple Silicon with 32–48GB unified memory). 34B and larger need A100 (40–80GB) or quantized/parallel approaches. Quantized versions (4/8-bit) enable use on 8GB–16GB consumer GPUs, but at reduced speed and performance.
    - System RAM of 32GB+ and a fast SSD are important for smooth experience.
4. Codestral 25.01 (Mistral AI):
    - 22B parameter range. Full precision needs 24GB+ VRAM (single RTX 3090/4090 or better). Quantized/CPU inference is possible with 8–16GB VRAM but with degraded performance or context window[^2_4].
    - System RAM of 32GB+ recommended, especially for large context sizes.
5. StarCoder2:
    - 7B: Can run on 8–12GB VRAM GPUs (RTX 3060/T4). For larger variants (16B, 34B), recommended is 24–40GB VRAM, with optimal smoothness on A100/H100 GPUs (40–80GB VRAM).
    - Quantized models let you run smaller variants on older GPUs or even on CPUs, with trade-offs in performance.

General System Recommendations:

- System RAM: 32GB-128GB depending on context size/model, but 64GB is a good default for heavy local LLM use[^2_2][^2_4].
- Storage: Fast NVMe SSD, 1TB+, required for model checkpoints and speedy operation[^2_2].
- For multi-GPU (parallelization) or CPU-only: Only practical for advanced setups; quantization is essential for low-memory devices[^2_3][^2_4][^2_6].
- Quantized/CPU versions: Sufficient for experimentation and basic development, not recommended for production-speed code generation[^2_3].

Important caveat: Hardware needs scale steeply with parameter count and context window. Always check if quantized (4/8-bit) versions are available for your platform as they can significantly lower the GPU VRAM requirement, though response time and performance will be diminished.

These are representative guidelines—always verify with the particular model documentation and tooling used (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp) for the latest compatibility and quantization support[^2_3][^2_4][^2_7].

# I want to use these models locally in my software firm, tell me the ways to do it in detail

There are two primary ways to deploy and use state-of-the-art open-source code generation models like Qwen 2.5 Coder, Code Llama, DeepSeek Coder V2, Codestral, and StarCoder2 locally in your software firm: using dedicated LLM runtimes (such as Ollama, LM Studio) or directly integrating via libraries like HuggingFace Transformers. Detailed approaches for local deployment, team access, and development workflow are as follows:

1. Using LLM Runtimes (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp)

This is the recommended approach for most organizations because of simplicity, ease of management, and ability to handle multiple users:

- **Ollama**: A popular choice, Ollama acts as a lightweight container/orchestration system for LLMs ("Docker for LLMs"), allowing you to pull, run, and serve models with minimal configuration. Models like Qwen 2.5 Coder, Code Llama, DeepSeek Coder, and StarCoder2 are available out-of-the-box.
    - **Installation**: Install Ollama on a server or workstation with sufficient GPU/CPU resources. Instructions:
        - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
        - macOS: Download from the Ollama website.
    - **Start the server**: `ollama serve`
    - **Download and run a model**: For example, `ollama run qwen2.5-coder`
    - **API Integration**: Ollama provides a local OpenAI-compatible API endpoint at `http://localhost:11434`, allowing easy integration with development tools, custom apps, or IDEs (VSCode, JetBrains, etc.)[^3_1][^3_6][^3_5][^3_7].
    - **Multi-user/Production Setup**: Deploy Ollama on a dedicated server; expose API on local network/VPN for your developers; manage access via network controls.
- **LM Studio and llama.cpp**: Similar to Ollama but focused on desktop/local workflows. They support diverse models (in GGUF, GPTQ, or safetensors format) and provide both GUI and REST endpoints for local inference and development tool integration.

2. Using HuggingFace Transformers (Direct Integration \& Customization)

For firms that need deeper integration, model fine-tuning, or enhanced control:

- **Install prerequisites**: Set up a Python environment on your local server (Ubuntu or similar is recommended). Ensure you have NVIDIA GPU drivers, CUDA, cuDNN, and Python 3.8+.
- **Install core libraries**: `pip install torch transformers accelerate huggingface_hub sentencepiece`
- **Download and load models**:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B", device_map="auto")
```

- **Serve via API**: Use frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or vLLM to expose a RESTful API for model inference. This allows your developers to connect to the internal LLM endpoint programmatically[^3_2].
- **Customization**: Supports custom prompt templates, chaining, or even further model fine-tuning/retraining with your proprietary code base.

3. Workflow Integration and Team Access

- **IDE plugins**: Many LLM backends (including Ollama) are compatible with VSCode extensions (continue, code-companion), JetBrains plugins, and web tools for seamless developer experience.
- **Batch/CI integration**: Use the local API to automate code review, generation, or static analysis in your CI/CD pipelines.
- **User management**: For production, manage access via network segmentation (private subnets/VPN), or layer an authentication proxy on the API endpoint.

4. Model Selection \& Scaling

- Choose the model size/variant suited to your hardware:
    - 7B models for single-desktop/easy local test (e.g., RTX 3060, 16GB RAM).
    - 14B/32B or larger for higher quality but require A100/4090 or multiple GPUs.
- Quantized models (4/8-bit) can reduce memory needs at a small cost to speed/accuracy.
- Disk and RAM requirements: Allocate at least 50GB+ for model storage and 32GB+ RAM for robust multi-user/team setups[^3_1][^3_2][^3_5].

5. Best Practices for Software Firms

- Prefer Ollama for easy start, uniform developer experience, and simple API (“docker-like” workflows).
- Use HuggingFace/Transformers for deeper model customization or if you intend to fine-tune LLMs on proprietary internal code.
- Always validate hardware compatibility and consider network/file system speed for large models.
- For high availability, consider running on a powerful Linux server with enterprise GPU(s); use local network only to restrict access.
